# The annotated map file (sort of)

# MapServer map file uses the pound sign (#) to denote the start of a line
# comment--each line that needs to be commented has to be prepended with a "#".
#
# Map files begin with MAP keyword to signify the start of the map object.
# Well, the entire map file is THE map object.  Enclosed between MAP and END
# at the very bottom of this map file, are keyword/value pairs and other
# objects.

  # Layer objects are defined beneath the map object.  You need at least one
  # layer defined in your map file before you can display a map...  You can
  # define as many layers as you'd like although a limit is typically hard-coded
  # in map.h in the MapServer source.  The default limit is set at 100.  You'd
  # have to have a very specialized application to need more than 100 layers in
  # your application.
